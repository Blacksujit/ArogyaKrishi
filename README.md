<p id="description">Problem statement ID: SIH - 1638 — Theme - Agri&amp;tech Background: Crop diseases can devastate yields leading to significant financial losses for farmers. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management. Description: Develop an AI-driven system that analyzes crop images and environmental data to predict potential disease outbreaks. This system will provide farmers with actionable insights and treatment recommendations to mitigate risks. Expected Solution: A mobile and web-based application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify crop diseases and suggest preventive measures and treatments based on real-time data.</p>
